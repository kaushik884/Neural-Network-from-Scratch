This is the repository for my project where I built a simple neural network from scratch on the MNIST numbers dataset without the use of PyTorch or TensorFlow. I built this project to better understand the mathematics behind the working of neural networks. In order to run this, clone the repository and download the MNIST dataset from here: https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/ and place in the same folder as the jupyter notebook.
